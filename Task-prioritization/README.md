This is the final project code from Group 6 in 5800 class.
We want to answer this question: How can we build a recommendation system that optimally prioritizes tasks for students with the maximum total value? Our goal is to help users effectively plan each month, promoting sustainable productivity and balance across key life areas: academics, career, health, and personal well-being.
We used graph construction, topological sort, max heap, and fractional knapsack algorithm in this project, to prioritize tasks.
